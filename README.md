# Truck-Route-Algorithm
A fairly simple python program that finds the shortest route between distances for a truck route.
The first section of code reads data from an excel file and brings it in to the program. Next, the 
data is categorized and organized so it can load the trucks based on different criteria. Once the
trucks are loaded, an algorithm finds the shortest path for each route and orders the route accordingly.
The trucks are then sent out and deliver the packages. The algorithm used is greedy heuristic algorithm 
and doesn't necessiarly find the shortest path of a route. A user has the ability to find out where
the trucks are at any given time as the route information can be displayed based on time.
